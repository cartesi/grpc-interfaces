# Cartesi gRPC Interfaces

The Cartesi gRPC Interfaces repository contains all gRPC and Protobuf definitions used in the gRPC interfaces of the Cartesi Project modules. Currently these comprehend:

- [cartesi-machine.proto](cartesi-machine.proto): contains the services exported by the cartesi machine that are consumed by the machine manager and also the definition of the lowest level messages used in multiple interfaces
- [machine-manager.proto](machine-manager.proto): services and higher level message types used to interact with the machine manager sessions
- [server-manager.proto](server-manager.proto): services and higher level message types used to interact with the server manager sessions
- [logger.proto](logger.proto): services and higher level message types used to interact with the logger-managed files

## Getting Started

This repository is not intended for standalone usage. Every repository that makes use of a gRPC interface, either serving or consuming a certain API, includes this repository as submodule and builds the language specific auto-generated code that implements the desired services and messages. Specifics on those can be checked in the individual repositories that include this as a submodule.
